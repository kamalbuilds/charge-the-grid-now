# SolCharge: Decentralized EV Charging Network

SolCharge is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) built on Solana that connects electric vehicle owners with charging stations through blockchain technology.

## üîå Overview

SolCharge allows anyone to register their EV charger into the network and earn passive income in the form of $WATT tokens. Simultaneously, EV owners gain access to a growing network of affordable charging stations around the world.

By removing intermediaries and leveraging blockchain technology, SolCharge creates a more efficient, transparent, and accessible EV charging ecosystem.

## üí° Key Features

- **Decentralized Charging Network**: Connect your charger and earn rewards for energy delivered
- **Dual-Token Economy**: CHARGE (governance) and WATT (utility) tokens create a balanced ecosystem
- **Smart Contracts**: Transparent pricing, automated payments, and verifiable energy delivery
- **Rating System**: Quality assurance through user ratings and reviews
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Scheduled maintenance tracking ensures reliable charging stations
- **Global Accessibility**: Use any charger in the network with your Solana wallet
- **Low Fees**: Near-zero gas fees on Solana make micropayments viable

## üìä Tokenomics

### CHARGE Token

- **Supply**: Fixed at 100,000,000 CHARGE
- **Distribution**:
  - Community Rewards: 40%
  - Protocol Treasury: 25%
  - Team & Advisors: 15%
  - Strategic Partners: 10%
  - Liquidity & Marketing: 10%
- **Utility**:
  - Governance voting
  - Payment for charging services
  - Staking to register chargers
  - Fee reduction for network users

### WATT Token

- **Supply**: Dynamic based on network usage (no fixed maximum)
- **Minting Conditions**:
  - 1 WATT per kWh of verified energy delivery
  - Charger uptime score above 95%
  - Positive user ratings (>4.5/5 stars)
- **Utility**:
  - Rewards for charger hosts
  - Convertible to CHARGE via staking
  - Access to premium network features

## üîç Contract Details

### Main Charging Contract (`lib.rs`)

This contract manages charging stations, sessions, and rewards:

- **Charger Registration**: Register an EV charger with location, pricing
- **Session Management**: Start and end charging sessions with automatic payment
- **Rating System**: Allow users to rate charging experiences
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Record and require periodic maintenance
- **Reward Distribution**: Calculate and distribute WATT tokens based on energy delivery

### Token Contract (`token_program.rs`)

Implements the CHARGE and WATT token functionality:

- **Token Creation**: Initialize both token types
- **Minting Logic**: Rules for minting new WATT tokens
- **Burning Mechanism**: Fee burning for deflationary pressure on CHARGE
- **Transaction Processing**: Handling payments with fee calculation

### Staking Contract (`staking.rs`)

Manages staking operations for charger hosts:

- **Stake to Register**: Staking CHARGE tokens to register a charger
- **Rewards Calculation**: Time-based reward accrual
- **Unstaking**: Rules for unstaking tokens after minimum period
- **Reward Claims**: Process for claiming accumulated rewards
